## Python(Programming):

[Restaurant Reviews Sentiment Analysis (Machine Learning/NLP)](https://github.com/Mathew-Gao/Restaurant-Review-sentiment-analysis--NLP-machine-learning) 

* Successfully analyzed 5500 restaurant reviews using natural language processing techniques, including TF-IDF, text classification, and sentiment analysis.

* Employed a range of machine learning models, including Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVC, using a mixed cross-validated grid search and cross-validated halving grid search and cross-validated random grid search to achieve high accuracy, macro average f1-score, and weighted average f1-score for text classification and sentiment analysis.

* Achieved a highest accuracy f1-score of 0.80 and a highest weighted average f1-score of 0.79 for text classification, and a highest accuracy f1-score of 0.71 and a highest weighted average f1-score of 0.69 for sentiment analysis.

* Successfully combined the text classification and sentiment analysis models to produce an aspect-based sentiment analysis table, which can be used to inform restaurant owners about areas of improvement in food, service, ambience, and price.

[Inspection schduling optimization](https://github.com/Mathew-Gao/Inspection-Schedule-Optimization)

* Developed a real-time framework for generating next-month work schedules for road inspection workers, optimizing workload and minimizing travel distance, resulting in significant efficiency and cost savings for Downer.

* Utilized Python and Gurobi to balance workload and minimize travel distance while considering constraints such as weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly road inspections and a daily driving distance limit.

* Processed millions of rows of Excel inputs and GPS data to create a user interface with controls for displaying schedules, routes, and route information each day for the next month.

* Applied advanced analytical techniques to solve a complex optimization problem, taking into account multiple constraints and using large amounts of data to achieve optimal solutions.

## R(Programming):

[Predicting Electricity Demand in Victoria](https://github.com/Mathew-Gao/Victoria-Electricity-Demand-Prediction)

* Developed a robust and accurate model to predict electricity demand, incorporating various external factors such as weather patterns, holidays, and COVID-related variables.

* Leveraged time series analysis, seasonal decomposition, Fourier transforms, and dynamic regression models to achieve high forecasting accuracy for both regular point forecasts and maximum demand predictions.

* Conducted rigorous model selection and assessment using various statistical measures, including the AICc, Box-Ljung test, Diebold-Mariano test, and coverage test, to ensure the model's reliability and validity.

* Identified limitations and opportunities for improvement, such as incorporating additional data sources and refining the modeling process, to provide insights for future research and development in the field of energy demand forecasting.

[Australian Temperature Modelling & Prediction](https://github.com/Mathew-Gao/Australian-Temperature-Prediction-Global-Warming)

* Provideed evidence of global warming using temperature data from 1950 to 2021 recorded at Laverton RAAF, with findings supported by both trend and seasonally adjusted plots under STL decomposition.

* Regression models were constructed and evaluated to estimate a positive temperature trend, with the piece-wise model performing the best in both model fitting and forecasting, capturing knot findings in line with the STL plot decomposition.

* Limitations include potential autocorrelation in residuals, limited training data and using data collected in only one location, but the report provides valuable insights into climate change patterns.

* Showcased technical skills in data analysis and modeling and provides valuable insights into climate change patterns.

## SQL(Programming):

[End-to-End Data Warehousing Process Using SQL](https://github.com/Mathew-Gao/Design-Create-Database-using-SQL)

* This repository presents a comprehensive report that demonstrates the end-to-end process of data warehousing for the Melbourne Business School settings, starting from the creation of tables to the development of a relational database, designing of star schemas, and the creation of user cases. The report also includes SQL code examples to illustrate and support the various stages of the data warehousing process.
